# Bank Marketing Analysis: Predicting Term Deposit Conversion 🏦📊

## 📌 Project Overview
This is my second data analysis portfolio project. In this project, I analyzed a massive telemarketing dataset (45,000+ rows) from a Portuguese banking institution. 

The main objective is to understand customer demographics and identify hidden patterns to predict which clients are most likely to subscribe to a term deposit. Instead of just visualizing data, the goal is to provide actionable business strategies to optimize the bank's future marketing campaigns.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **MySQL:** Used for data extraction, handling missing values (NULLs), and cleaning the dataset to ensure data integrity before analysis.
- **Tableau Public:** Used for building an interactive dashboard to visualize trends, compare demographics, and find business insights.

## 💡 Key Insights & Business Recommendation
While analyzing the data, I discovered a significant behavioral pattern:
- **The "Student" Anomaly:** Students have the highest conversion rates for term deposits, but specifically during the months of **April-July** and **November**. 
- **The "Why":** This aligns perfectly with European summer breaks, graduation gifts, and pre-winter financial planning.
- **Actionable Strategy:** The bank can significantly optimize its telemarketing budget by launching targeted "Student Deposit Promos" exclusively during those peak months, while shifting focus to other professions (like management or blue-collar workers) for the rest of the year.
